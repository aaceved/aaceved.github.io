                <p>Once again, I am Angel Acevedo. I am currently pursing my BS in Computer Science as a Junior at Western Governors Univerity (WGU). My current position is a Psychiatric Technician at an acute crisis facility for adolescent and adult individuals. I have been in the mental health/developmental disability field for the past 6 years, but have been interested in technology since my youth. I am currently learning Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am also learning how to use GitHub and learning about repositories. I am excited to learn more about the world of technology and how I can use it to help others.</p>
